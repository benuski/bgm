## Bromley Genealogical Markdown

Right now, the beginning genealogist doesn't have a ton of options when they want to leave online family tree tools. There is a gap between the easy to use but limiting platforms and the extremely robust but technical open source and professional tools.

My personal need was for a text-based, card file style genealogical system, something that is small, portable, and both machine- and human-readable. Genealogical research can last decades or more, so I wanted future generations to be able to completely and easily read the information without the need for any additional tools.

Markdown was the obvious tool, and creating a standardized genealogical frontmatter would bridge this gap between toolsets. This format, initially called Bromley Genealogical Markdown, is designed for ease of use, easy textual display, and ability to move between a tabular view and individual files. The information contained in the front matter should be easily convertible between YAML and CSV.

The data fields for this project maintain compatibility with data fields from the gramps project, from which I have learned so much about genealogy in the digital age. None of this would be possible without [gramps](https://gramps-project.org) and the [gramps wiki](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Main_page). I will attempt to document the crosswalk as I build out this format.
