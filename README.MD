Right now, the beginning genealogist doesn't have a ton of options when they want to leave online family tree tools. There is a gap between the easy to use but limiting online tools and the extremely robust but technical open source and professional tools.

My personal need was for a text-based, card file style genealogical system, something that is small, portable, and both machine- and human-readable. Genealogical research can last decades or more, so I wanted future generations to be able to completely and easily read the information without the need for any additional tools.

This format, initially called Bromley Genealogical Markdown, is designed for ease of use, easy textual display, and ability to move between a tabular view and individual files. The information contained in the front matter should be easily convertible between YAML and CSV, and the body material can come over in additional columns.

I hope to maintain general compatibility with GEDCOM 7.0 data fields and will attempt to document the crosswalk as I build out this format. Inspiration on fields, naming, and data field definitions comes from the GEDCOM project.
